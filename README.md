# SwipeableTableviews

Swipe Between Tableviews using an UIPanGestureRecognizer (Swift 2.0)

This was made to avoid scrolling problems with UIScrollView written

The code alse reuses the tableviews for better performance only keeping the visible one.

The code was inspired by -> https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwipeView for the reusing part.

It is very simple to use just implement the  SwipeableTableViewsDataSource and SwipeableTableViewsDelegate 

You can see the full example in the ViewController file in the project.
